## Python Chess Game
Make sure both files (chess.py and pawn.py) are in the same working directory

To start the game run chess.py

Pick your move by entering the (x,y) coordinate of the piece you want to move
followed by the (x,y) coordinate of where you want to move that piece

The CPU will consider two moves ahead and focus on capturing pieces and
taking control of the board
